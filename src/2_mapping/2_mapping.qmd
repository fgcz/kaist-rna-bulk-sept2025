# Mapping with STAR

For this section, we will be aligning our processed fastqs using STAR [@dobin2012].

## Downloading test data

First, let's download our dataset for this section. If you haven't already, please delete all fastp generated data from the previous section. Don't worry, we will download it at a later point again from the FGCZ server. Then, let's download our test data for this section: fastp-processed files which have been downsampled by 10X to speed up alignment.

```{bash}
CURR_DIR=$(pwd)
cd ../..

# Download the data
FASTP_OUTDIR=results/1_qc/fastp_downsampled
mkdir -p $FASTP_OUTDIR
cd $FASTP_OUTDIR
echo "Depositing data in "$FASTP_OUTDIR
curl -O https://fgcz-gstore.uzh.ch/public/RNASeqCourse/yeast_fastp_downsampled_for_STAR.tar

# Extract data
tar -xvf yeast_fastp_downsampled_for_STAR.tar
rm -f yeast_fastp_downsampled_for_STAR.tar

# back home
cd $CURR_DIR
```

Now that the data has been downloaded, let's see exactly what we are dealing with. To this end, run the following cell. It calls [seqkit](https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit/usage/) to output some stats about the fastq files.

```{bash}
/opt/seqkit stats ../../results/1_qc/fastp_downsampled/*fastq.gz
```

### Exercise #1

1.  How many reads does each sample have? How does this compare to the input fastq files?

2.  Is the minimum length of each read in the fastq files expected?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solutions

1.  As expected, each sample has around a tenth of the input reads of our initial sequencing data. 500'000 to 1'000'000 may seem like little considering the general recommendation of 20M for bulk RNA-seq, but it is enough to actually get reasonable results for yeast.
2.  Yes, we specified a minimum length of 30bp when we ran fastp, which is what we see in the seqkit output.

## Running STAR

We are now ready to run the STAR aligner on our inputs. This part can take a while (\~15 minutes), so look over commands in the meantime.

```{bash}
CURR_DIR=$(pwd)
cd ../..

TRIMMED_FASTQS=results/1_qc/fastp_downsampled
OUTPUT_DIR=results/2_mapping/STAR_alignment
mkdir -p $OUTPUT_DIR

# Start processing with fastp
for FASTQ in $TRIMMED_FASTQS/*_trimmed_R1.fastq.gz
  do SAMPLE_NAME=$(basename ${FASTQ%_trimmed_R1.fastq.gz})
  echo $FASTQ
  
  # First do alignment with STAR using a pre-built index
  time /opt/STAR \
    --genomeDir data/supplementary-files/Ensembl_R64_genes_STARIndex \

  # Sort and index
  samtools sort -l 9 -m 2625M -@ 4 $OUTPUT_DIR/$SAMPLE_NAME.out.bam -o $OUTPUT_DIR/$SAMPLE_NAME.bam
  rm -f $OUTPUT_DIR/$SAMPLE_NAME.out.bam
  samtools index $OUTPUT_DIR/$SAMPLE_NAME.bam
  
  # “Guess” how RNA-seq sequencing were configured
  infer_experiment.py -r data/supplementary-files/Ensembl_R64_genes/genes.bed \
    -i $OUTPUT_DIR/$SAMPLE_NAME.bam -s 200000 > $OUTPUT_DIR/$SAMPLE_NAME"_inferred.txt"
done

rm -rf $TRIMMED_FASTQS

# Back home
cd $CURR_DIR
```

### Exercise #2

1.  Take a look at the files ending in "\_Log.final.out". Which sample has the highest percentage of primary alignments? Which has the lowest percentage?
2.  What is the range of splices for the samples? Do you think these are real?

## Alignment QC

Let's first take a look at the outputs.
